/**
 * Interface for log events emitted by the `MSSQL` class.
 * Used to capture detailed information about database queries.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const mssql = new MSSQL(options);
 * mssql.on(EVENT_MSSQL.LOG, (log: MssqlEventLog) => {
 *     console.log(log);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @remarks
 * This interface is intended for internal logging and debugging of MSSQL queries.
